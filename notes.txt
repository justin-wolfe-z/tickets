//CONCEPT
// register session as active in background script when user hits the button and inactive once done
// use a content script to send a message when a HS page loads regarding whether somebody is on the ticket
// save those in the background when session is active
// in background get the JSON for the tickets
// then go through and start opening individual tickets from each folder in new tabs
// each time a tab is opened, use setinterval to wait until a message has been registered for it by the content script
// then use logic - if the ticket is unassigned, assign it to the user, and move on to opening tabs for the next ticket
// if it's not, go on to the next ticket in the array and open a tab for that one

// shifts changing priority
// ahs complicates it a little bit
// AHS four hours or less assignment
